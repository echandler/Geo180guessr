# Geo180guessr
Play Geoguessr upside down.

### How do you use it? Every thing is backwards, it hurts my head?
Yep, it's hard at first, it takes about 20 rounds (4 games) to get used to it and probably 50 rounds (10 games) for it to feel normal.

### How do you install it?
First install Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for FireFox. Then click this [link](https://github.com/echandler/Geo180guessr/raw/main/geo180guessr.user.js) and choose the install option. If that doesn't work manually create a new script and copy and paste the geo180guessr.user.js file into it.

Have fun!
